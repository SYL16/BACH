## BACH: Bayesian Analysis Pipeline for Analyzing Concurrent Response Rate Data with Heterogeneity in Basket Trials

## Overview

The goal of **BACH** is to provide a Bayesian analysis pipeline for analyzing concurrent response rate data with heterogeneity in basket trials. The package is designed to identify subgroups with extremely small sample sizes and mitigate their impact on information sharing, allowing for more flexible information borrowing that accounts for heterogeneity in key factors such as response rates and sample sizes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **BACH** from GitHub using the following commands in R:

```r
# Install devtools if you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")

# Install BACH from GitHub
devtools::install_github("SYL16/BACH")
